# scs-file-generator-puffs
A mess of scripts and stuff to generate SCS11 files from mic plot spreadsheets, made for the Ridge High School Fall 2021 production of *Puffs*
## Disclaimer
This "code" is a complete mess. It is a very rough system, with very minor order in very few places. Do not try to use it. You will get a headache. This is only public so myself and other people who need it can access it quickly. A more complete and orderly version of this may be made in the future.
